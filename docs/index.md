# Ezber

Ezber is an open-source spaced repetition flash card app based not on
one's speed of response. Ezber is the Turkish word for memorization. The
concept is inspired by the popular Anki software. Here, instead of
choosing how well you feel you know something, spaced repetition will be
based on your ability to provide the correct answer in a timeframe that
is comparable to your best known knowledge.

Initially, this will target early learning facts like 10x10 arithmetic
tables (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). But can be
adapted to handle language learning and input sources other than the
keyboard (e.g. voice).
